# Employee Performance Prediction

This project predicts employee performance using **Machine Learning** techniques. It is designed to run on **Google Colab** and helps HR teams make data-driven decisions regarding promotions, training, and workforce management.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
Employee performance prediction is a supervised machine learning problem where the goal is to **predict whether an employee will perform well or not** based on various factors such as:

- Work experience  
- Attendance  
- Skills  
- Previous performance metrics  

By analyzing these features, the model can assist in **identifying high-performing employees** and optimizing organizational efficiency.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `pandas` – Data handling  
  - `numpy` – Numerical operations  
  - `scikit-learn` – Machine learning models  
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – Data visualization  
- **Platform:** Google Colab  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset should be in CSV format.  
- Columns can include features like `EmployeeID`, `Experience`, `Department`, `Attendance`, `SkillScore`, `PerformanceRating`, etc.  
- Example:  
| EmployeeID | Experience | Department | Attendance | SkillScore | PerformanceRating |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------------|
| 101        | 5          | IT         | 95         | 80         | High             |
| 102        | 2          | HR         | 88         | 70         | Medium           |

---

## 🧩 Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale numerical features.  
- **Model Training**: Train models like Decision Tree, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machine.  
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.  
- **Visualization**: Visualize feature importance, performance distribution, and correlations.

## 💻 How to Run in Google Colab
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  
2. Upload the dataset CSV file.  
3. Open the project notebook (`Employee_Performance_Prediction.ipynb`).  
4. Run all cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and make predictions.  

Example code snippet to load data in Colab:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Upload dataset
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()

# Load CSV
data = pd.read_csv('employee_data.csv')
data.head()
````

## 📈 Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection** – Gather employee-related data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understand data distribution and relationships.
3. **Data Preprocessing** – Clean data, handle missing values, encode categorical features.
4. **Model Training & Testing** – Train machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
5. **Prediction & Insights** – Predict employee performance and generate actionable insights.
